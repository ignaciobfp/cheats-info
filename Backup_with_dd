Assuming root user or sudo for all commands

Disk to disk backup
dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 of=/dev/nvme1n1 bs=64M conv=noerror,sync status=progress

Trick to copy on the fly (tube dd to itself), can increase speed a bit
dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 conv=sync,noerror bs=64M | dd of=/dev/nvme1n1


Disk to image backup (compressed)
dd if=/dev/sda conv=sync,noerror bs=64M | gzip -c  > /PATH/TO/DRIVE/backup_image.img.gz
